# Learn languages

This repository contains some mini-projects carried out in a few languages in order to get a little approach to each language. Works as something like "My first project in X lang". I won't include GUI's, because the main idea is to explore the basics of each language.

What I try to explore in each language:

- Data types
- Control structures
- Data structures
- Methods - Objects

Each project has a `README.md` file, it contains instructions to run the project and help to use the commands
Each project has a `NOTES.md` file, it contains notes about the language.

## The Farm

A simple CLI game, where you can take care of animals. You have to give feed and wash your animals, avoiding their death. Each animal has a time limit in which it can be without food and without a shower.

- Allows to create animals.
- Allows to delete animals.
- Allows to list animals.
- Allows to list animals by age.
- Allows to list animals by type.
- Allows to search a specific animal.
- Allows to give food to an animal.
- Allows to give a shower to an animal.
- Allows to check if the animal is alive.
- Allows to get help.

## Pending
- [ ] Document IO and Dates.
- [ ] Refactor all projects
- [ ] Improve CLI printing and commands
- [ ] Add a special character when the animal is eating or bathing
- [ ] Add unit tests
